This is a project from Khan Academy I completed.

CREATE TABLE books (id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY, name TEXT, rating INTEGER, price INTEGER, aisle INTEGER);
INSERT INTO books VALUES (1, "LOTR", 5, $5, 10);
INSERT INTO books VALUES (2, "NOTW", 4, $6, 10);
INSERT INTO books VALUES (3, "WMF", 3, $7, 10);
INSERT INTO books VALUES (4, "LOVE",4,$2, 2);
INSERT INTO books VALUES (5, "BYE",1,$1,3);
SELECT name FROM books ORDER BY rating;
SELECT SUM(rating) FROM books ORDER BY rating;
